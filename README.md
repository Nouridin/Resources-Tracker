**The ultimate tool for server admins who want to maintain a fair and transparent gameplay environment.**

This lightweight, high-performance plugin silently logs player activity‚Äîspecifically, which blocks are broken and which items are picked up. It provides you with the detailed insights you need to identify potential cheaters (like X-rayers) and keep a close eye on your server's economy and player progress.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Comprehensive Logging:** Tracks every block broken and every item picked up by any player on the server.
*   **High-Performance Database:** Powered by **SQLite**, ResourcesTracker is designed for speed and scalability.
*   **Detailed Statistics Book:** Generate an in-game book with a complete, up-to-the-second statistical report for any player.
*   **Powerful Search:** Instantly filter a player's statistics for specific items directly from the command.
*   **Configurable Admin Alerts:** Receive real-time, in-game notifications when a player obtains a high-value item.
*   **Automatic Update Checker:** Stay informed! The plugin automatically checks for new versions on Modrinth.

## üöÄ Building from Source

To build ResourcesTracker yourself, you'll need:

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher
*   Apache Maven

Simply clone the repository and run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will generate the plugin JAR file in the `target` directory.

## üéÆ How to Use

Using ResourcesTracker is simple. The main command is `/rstats`.

### View Player Statistics

To get a full statistical report for a player, use:

```
/rstats <player_name>
```

### Search for Specific Items

To narrow down the results to a specific item, simply add a search term:

```
/rstats <player_name> <search_term>
```

### Control Notifications

To toggle notifications for yourself:

```
/rstats notifications <enable|disable>
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Permissions

*   `resourcestracker.notify`: Players with this permission will receive real-time alerts. (Admins/Mods only)

*Note: By default, the `/rstats` command is OP-only, but this can be changed in the `config.yml`.*

## üîß Configuration

The `config.yml` file is simple and well-documented:

```yaml
# A list of materials that will trigger a notification.
notify-on:
  - DIAMOND_ORE
  - ANCIENT_DEBRIS

# Whether only OPs can use the /rstats command.
Only-OP: true

# Whether to check for new updates on startup.
check-for-updates: true
```
